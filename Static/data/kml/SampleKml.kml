                <description>Our third night, after a long hike. Incredible views of Spirit Lake and The Dome. From the pass to the east, you can see Mount Rainier, Mount Adams, Mount Hood, and Mount St. Helens: 4 volcanoes in one view!</description>

                <description>We were supposed to stay here our fourth night, but the camp was really rather depressing, hot, and we still had a good part of the day ahead of us, so we hiked on.</description>

                <description>The end of our hike. We had to get from here back to our car, and it&amp;apos;s amazing how few people (none, in fact) stop to pick up a hiker in a National Park.</description>
